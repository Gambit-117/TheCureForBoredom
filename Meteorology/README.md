# Intro

Meteorology is the scientific study of the Earth, its atmosphere, and its weather, with a focus on short-term weather forecasting, quantifying and qualifying atmospheric phenomena, and measurements primarily within the troposphere. While the extent of this field is quite complex, hobbiests can very easily get involved in meteorology in a variety of ways.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is a US Government agency that provides an immense amount of meteorological data and training opportunities for professionals and hobby scientists (As I am a US citizen, I am unfamiliar with other countries' equivalent agencies). NOAA offers a treasure trove of information in their Sea to Sky resource database which can be found at https://www.noaa.gov/education/resources. 

For more hands-on and exciting hobbiest opportunities, NOAA also offers a student opportunity database at https://www.noaa.gov/education/opportunities/students. Some of these opportunities, especially the citizen scientist or other volunteer opportunities, do not have any US citizen requirements to take part in. For US citizens and professionals, other full-time opportunities are also available. 

The National Weather Service, an offshoot of NOAA, has fantastic hobbiest opportunities and certifications that are not challenging to obtain. These include the SKYWARN Storm Spotter Program, the Cooperative Observer (COOP) program, mPING crowdsourcing weather reports, and the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS). Each of these are described in further detail in their own directories.

Other learning opportunities, coursework, clubs, and research are often available on a community basis. Penn State World Campus has some very interesting undergraduate and graduate certificate programs where students can actively study meteorology for academic credit. 

# How to Start
- Search the NOAA and NWS websites to gather information and determine if you might enjoy this as a hobby.
- Become a SKYWARN National Storm Watcher by taking a free 2-hour course either in person or on the internet (depends on the local NWS office requirements).
- Download the mPING app for free and send anonymous reports about weather at your location.
- Download the CrowdMag app for free and send anonymous reports about the earth's magnetic field. 
- Join CoCoRaHS for free and purchase a rain gauge for under $100 to collect and send data.
- Explore the MetEd COMET catalogue for free courses and resources.

# Advanced or Expensive Options
- Join the NWS Cooperative Observer Program and purchase equipment to set up a site on your property to collect real-time environmental data, submit reports, and receive audits from your local NWS office. 
- Get a certificate in Weather Forecasting from Penn State World Campus.


# Where to go from here 
- For those interested in tech, NOAA SKYWARN programs directly integrate with amateur ham radio and other technological hobbies.
- For those interested in the environment and environmental science, NWS has a national extension directly into a master gardener program. 
- For those interested in physical activity, CrowdMag measurements can easily be taken while walking, running, or hiking.
